# Plotly Belly Button
## Project Overview

The Plotly Belly Button project was created to visualize naval bacterial data from volunteers across the country so that Improbable Beef company could identify bacterial species to produce synthetic beef. 

## Website 

The website contains a dropdown menu listing each volunteer's ID number so they can remain anonymous. When selecting an ID number from the dropdown menu, we see a bar chart displaying the top 10 bacterial species found in the navel, a bubble chart showing the number of bacteria per sample, and a gauge chart that shows the belly button washing frequency.

Here's the website to explore the interactive charts.
